      <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Hutchins">Wikipedia says:
         Marcus Hutchins, also known online as MalwareTech, is a British computer security researcher known for temporarily stopping the WannaCry ransomware attack.[1][2] He is employed by cybersecurity firm Kryptos Logic.[3][4] Hutchins is from Ilfracombe, Devon, UK.[5] <br>

In August 2017, Hutchins was arrested in Las Vegas (where he was attending the DEF CON conference) after being indicted on six hacking-related federal charges in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Prosecutors allege that Hutchins assisted in the creation and spread of a piece of banking malware known as Kronos in 2014 and 2015. The charges are not related to WannaCry,[6][7] but included the allegations that he created the Kronos malware in 2014, and sold it in 2015 via the AlphaBay forums.[8][9] Hutchins denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to the charges against him on August 2017.[10][11] He was out on bail pending trial and remained in Los Angeles.[12] In early June 2018, the U.S. government added four more charges to his indictment.[13]<br>

On 19 April 2019 Hutchins pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud, as well as distributing, selling, promoting, and advertising a device used to intercept electronic communications.[14] His statement included the quote "I regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes. Having grown up, Iâ€™ve since been using the same skills that I misused several years ago for constructive purposes".[15] Hutchins faced up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines for two charges related to writing malware in the years prior to his career in security.[16] On 26 July, 2019, Hutchins was sentenced to time served and one year of supervised release.[17]<br></a></p>
